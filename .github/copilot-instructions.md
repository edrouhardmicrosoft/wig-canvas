# Copilot instructions (Canvas)

If the task requires visual inspection (layout/spacing/alignment/visibility/overlap/clipping), use the Canvas skill.

The Canvas skill definitions live under:

- .canvas/tools/canvas/skills

If the skill is not registered yet, register it once:

- /skills add .canvas/tools/canvas/skills

Then confirm it is available:

- /skills list

After that, use the `canvas` skill for visual inspection.
